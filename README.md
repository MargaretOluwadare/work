# work
This project is aimed at demonstrating statistical analysis using R

The Task: Analyze a new dataset (you have to come up with one).
It should contain at least 100 rows and 5 columns (numeric or categorical variables).

The analysis should include:

1) Import and preparation of your data.

2) Descriptive summary statistics for at least 2 variables. Summary statistics
should include at least mean, standard deviation and median for numerical and frequency tables for categorical variables. Summary statistics should be presented aggregated and separately for different groups (e.g., control vs. treatment). Summary statistics have to be reported in the text (only bullet points or tables are not sufficient).

3) 2 plots showing the distribution of a variable (e.g., histogram or barplot) and at least 1 plot showing the connection between two variables (e.g., scatterplot) including a regression line when possible. Draw confidence intervals where possible. Use customized headings, axes labels, colors and legends.

4) Calculate inferential statistics (at least 2 appropriate group comparison tests and 1 appropriate generalized linear model including at least 1 interaction).


The Final Submission:
Your submission must consist of a full text (no bullet points) written in a pdf or doc file that has an introduction (describe your data set, your IV and DV, and your hypotheses), an analysis section (report all your results according to APA style including plots), and a conclusion (verbalize and interpret your results and respond to your hypotheses).

In addition, you should submit your R-code fully commented and running without errors and the raw data file (in .txt or .csv). This should allow me to reproduce all your presented results.
